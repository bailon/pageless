    </header>
    <pre>
A page, my page, a light unveiled,
In cyberspace, where secrets sailed.
I crafted runes in lines of code,
My will, my Word, in ether flowed.

No temple stone, nor ancient tome,
Yet here within, I make my home.
A vessel bound in electric thread,
Where thoughts ignite, and dreams are fed.

Thelema’s call—do what thou wilt,
In pixels bright, my world is built.
From shadows deep to blazing heights,
Each click reveals arcane delights.

With every keystroke, banners rise,
In sacred fonts, my truths disguise.
A sigil here, a glyph below,
To lure the minds that seek to know.

For Love is law, and Law is free,
A boundless web, my symphony.
And in this space, my truth unfolds,
A digital grimoire, secrets told.

Thus, here I stand, a magus proud,
In webs I weave, my will avowed.
A page, my page, my endless scroll,
The grand unveiling of my soul.
